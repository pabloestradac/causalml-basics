# causalml-basics

This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks that are based on the labs from the book [Applied Causal Inference Powered by ML and AI](https://causalml-book.org). My goal is to provide simplified versions of the labs, using the same code but different datasets.

The notebooks are organized as follows:

1. [**Wage Prediction using Lasso**](Wage_Prediction_Lasso.ipynb): This notebook is based on the lab from Chapter 1 of the book. The goal is to predict the wage of an individual based on their characteristics.
2. [**Wage Gap based on Sex using Lasso**](Wage_Gap_Lasso.ipynb): This notebook is based on the lab from Chapter 1 of the book. The goal is to explain the wage gap based on observed characteristics and unobserved factors.
