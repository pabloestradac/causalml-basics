# causalml-basics

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks focused on machine learning methods for causal inference. Each notebook provides applied examples using simulated and real data.

The notebooks are organized as follows:

1. [**OLS and Overfitting**](notebooks/OLS.ipynb): basic functionalities of `statsmodels` and `pyfixest` for linear regression with the case of overfitting.
2. [**Regression with Lasso**](notebooks/Lasso.ipynb): prediction of wages using penalized linear regression.
3. [**Classification Models**](notebooks/Classification.ipynb): basics of classification and model evaluation using `sklearn`.
4. [**Clustering**](notebooks/Clustering.ipynb): This notebooks explores dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering.
5. [**Tree-based Methods**](notebooks/Trees.ipynb): Basic introduction to tree-based methods like Decision Trees and Random Forest.
6. [**Neural Networks**](notebooks/Neural_Networks.ipynb): Basic introduction to neural networks using `sklearn` and `pytorch`.
7. [**Regression using ML**](notebooks/ML.ipynb): This notebook is based on a lab from Chapter 9 of the book Causal ML. The goal is to predict wages using non-linear models and stacking.
8. [**Double/Debiased ML**](notebooks/DML.ipynb): IN PROGRESS
9.  [**Heterogeneous Treatment Effects**](notebooks/CATE.ipynb): IN PROGRESS
