# causalml-basics

This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks that are based on the labs from the book [Applied Causal Inference Powered by ML and AI](https://causalml-book.org). My goal is to provide simplified versions of the labs, using the same code but different datasets.

The notebooks are organized as follows:

1. [**OLS and Overfitting**](notebooks/OLS.ipynb): This notebook shows the basic functionalities of `statsmodels` and `pyfixest` for linear regression with the case of overfitting.
2. [**Regression with Lasso**](notebooks/Lasso.ipynb): This notebook is based on a lab from Chapter 1 of the book. The goal is to predict wages using penalized linear regression.
3. [**Classification with Linear Methods**](notebooks/Classification.ipynb): IN PROGRESS
4. [**Clustering**](notebooks/Clustering.ipynb): IN PROGRESS
5. [**Tree-based Methods**](notebooks/Trees.ipynb): IN PROGRESS
6. [**Neural Networks**](notebooks/Neural_Networks.ipynb): IN PROGRESS
7. [**Regression using ML**](notebooks/ML.ipynb): This notebook is based on a lab from Chapter 9 of the book. The goal is to predict wages using non-linear models.
8. [**Double/Debiased ML**](notebooks/DML.ipynb): IN PROGRESS
9. [**Heterogeneous Treatment Effects**](notebooks/CATE.ipynb): IN PROGRESS
